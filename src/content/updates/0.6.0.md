+ Add a "pinboard" to the homepage, where content can be displayed.
+ Show a more prominent way to the latest update of the repository
+ Fix some issues regarding the layout.
+ Add a size attribute to all patterns that is being used to make downloaded patterns _actually_ repeatable just as images. Before their size was uniform, which resulted in some patterns that were non-repeatable. They are now downloaded with their intrinsic size, instead of a uniform size.
+ Update the favicon to be more... nice? I am hoping.
+ Removed the full sprite. I don't think there is any use for that. Let me know if that is not the case!
