title: "0.2.0"

+ Moved all the JavaScript from template files into their own respective files. All JavaScript is included as native modules.
+ The navigation is now collapsed into a open- & closable menu. The meni can be opened and closed via buttons. They are keyboard accessible and focus is managed and _should_ be WCAG compliant.
+ Added a "Sprite" of all the patterns. They can be accessed with url fragments, for example `background-image: url('/patterns.svg#view-pattern-17')`, thanks to the `<view>` element.
+ Individual Patterns are now also available from `/svg/pattern/{id}.svg`.
+ I also added a json output for all patterns combined at `/api/patterns.json`, and for individual patterns via `/api/pattern/{id}.json`. I don't know if this is valuable to anyone! Let me know please!
+ I also added favicons. And they even update based on what page you are on. Plus, they are dark-mode aware!
+ There are titles for all pages now!
