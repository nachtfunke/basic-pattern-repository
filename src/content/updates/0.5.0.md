+ Fixed an issue that made the previous button shift to the inline-end on the last pattern. It now always sits on the inline-start position and the next button always sits on the inline-end position.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented a listed pattern with `aria-current="page"` from being clicked.

### New Patterns added

+ Added 8 new point based patterns - centered and off-centered!
+ Added 8 new dot based patterns - centered and off-centered!
+ Added 3 vertical zig-zag patterns
