+ Updated the `package.json` version number. Oops!
+ Fixed an issue with the skip-to-content not spanning the entirety of the width on large screens.
+ Added a GNU GPL v3 License. Hopefully that's the right one.
+ The project version is now displayed at the bottom of the page, with a link to the updates page.
+ There is now a download-link on each pattern's single view to download an SVG file.
+ I also finally added a readme.
